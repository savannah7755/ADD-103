            <p>Following the joyful Easter egg hunt, everyone is warmly invited to join us for a spirited church service that celebrates the season’s hope and renewal. The service will be filled with uplifting hymns and a meaningful message that reflects the essence of Easter. Afterward, families can capture the fun of the day with photos alongside our special guest, the Easter Bunny, who will be available for pictures. For those children who couldn’t participate in the egg hunt, don’t worry—goodie bags brimming with Easter treats will be handed out to ensure everyone leaves with a smile. It's a wonderful opportunity to come together in faith and fellowship, creating lasting memories with loved ones. </p>
