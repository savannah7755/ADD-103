<p>The Twilight movie series is a comfort movie for me, even though it faces a lot of hate. The movie is about a young girl who moves states to live with her dad, but while shes there, she is introduced to a world full of supernaturals. Her love interests end up being a vampire and werewolf, the competition between the two is a huge part of the movies. </p> <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
<h2>Bellas story</h2>
<p>The main character, Bella, falls more for the vampire Edward, rather than the werewolf, Jacob. She grows close with his whole vampire family and get's involved in a lot of the vampire drama, while her own father doesn't know what she is up to. Bella is faced with a tough choice throught the begginging of the movies, which is whether she wants to wait for Edward after he abandoned her, or give Jacob a chance after he was there for her for those long months. Bella ends up choosing to marry Edward, and is adement on him turning her to a vampire, but he refuses because he thinks it's the wrong choice. Bella miraculously ends up pregnant, and nearly dies in the birthing process, and despite Edwards attempts to save her by biting his venom into her, the half vampire, half human baby is the one that saves her life. The movie nears and end when The vampire government finds out about this child, and demands to meet her because they are under the impression she is an out of control child, like most child vampires used to be. After a glimpse into the future at a fatal fight, which would cost most of the government their lives. they step down, and everyone lives their lives.   </p>

    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
<h3><blockquote> "So the lion fell in love with the lamb."</blockquote>My favorite scene out of the whole series is when Edward thinks Bella is dead, so he tries to reveal himself to humans during a parade, so the government would have no choice but to get rid of him. He didn't want to live anymore without her, but she runs into his arms before he gets the chance to reveal himslf to the people.</h3>
