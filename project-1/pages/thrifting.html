Thrifting is one of my favorite hobbies because it feels like a treasure hunt, full of surprises and opportunities to find great deals. I love being able to get high-quality items, especially clothes, for just a fraction of their original price—paying full price for things has never been my style. Unlike regular stores, where you see multiple copies of the same item, thrift stores are a collection of unique pieces, each with its own story. You never know what you're going to find, and that unpredictability is what makes it exciting. To me, thrifting is almost like a competition—digging through the racks to uncover the hidden gems and walking away with the best finds is always a thrill. My favorite store to thrift at is the goodwill in Huntley, which is the only store I go to because of the half off colored tag day promotion. My newest treasure hunt is for a wood stained dresser with shelves and mirrors attached, so that I can take the mirror off of the dresser and put it on my desk to replace my tiny mirror. The shelves would make amazing storage for my hair and makeup items.

    I fell in love with the jeans in this picture that I found at the Goodwill in Huntley, but unfortunatley didn't end up buying them because they were a tad bit too short.
