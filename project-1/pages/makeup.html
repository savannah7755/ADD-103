                Makeup is something I genuinely love because it lets me accentuate my features in a way that makes me feel confident and put together. My favorite part of my makeup routine is definitely my eyelashes. I used to wear mascara religiously, but after losing so many lashes from curling them several times a day, I made the switch to false lashes—and I've never looked back. Now, I tell people to imagine their face without eyebrows, and that's exactly how I feel when I don’t have my false lashes on: naked. Applying them has become second nature, taking only ten to fifteen minutes, but they last me about a week or even longer. The best part about my lashes is that they make the rest of my makeup routine much faster. What used to take ten minutes just to do my mascara now takes the same amount of time for my entire face! When it comes to makeup products, I don't typically splurge on high-end brands, except for my foundation and concealer—those are the essentials I can justify spending a bit more on.

                I chose to use this picture becuase my makeup was freshly done. This is a little heavier than my day to day look. I was going to visit my friend at her collage in Wisconsin after my shift at work, so I needed this makeup to last. In a situation like this were I need my makeup to really last, I'll soak my face in setting spray and load it up with primer before adding any makeup. Honestly when i'm just doing my makeup for work or class, I dont do any prep or setting because it's time consuming to let them both dry. It's not great for your face, but worth it to me to not have to wait, and deal with the sticky residue left on your face all day.
