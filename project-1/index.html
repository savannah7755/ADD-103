            <p>

Hi there! I'm from Union, Illinois, a small town nestled between Huntley and Marengo. I come from a big family with four siblings. I work at a bowling alley/fine dining restaurant—it's an unusual combination, I know, but I love it! I've been there for over two years, and the best part is our regulars, most of whom are older and always make my day. At home, I have two cats named Buddy and Kanye, and a dog named Gus who always keeps things lively. In my free time, I love hanging out with my boyfriend, going on car rides, and spending time with friends. You'll also hear a lot about two of my favorite hobbies—thrifting and makeup—on the next few pages!

I'm also lucky to have a truck-obsessed boyfriend who keeps life interesting. I love going to his truck shows with him, especially because I enjoy long car rides, and it's a great excuse to explore new places. The last show we went to was in Oklahoma, and it was a lot of fun for me—though the drive was a different story for him. It was nine hours straight on those massive wheels, which made for a rough ride, and since I’m not comfortable driving his truck, I couldn't help with the driving at all. Despite that, I love being a part of his passion and sharing those experiences with him, even if it means just being along for the ride.
