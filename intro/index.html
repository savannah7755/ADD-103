    <h1>savannahs introduciton</h1>
    <p>I am taking this class as a step toward getting an interior design certificate. I decided to take this class in person this year, because I attempted to take it online last year, and it didn't come very easily to me. I decided to drop it and try again in person.
        <h2>Savannahs hobbies</h2>

</p>Car rides are the most relaxing thing to me. I'm not quite sure I would call it a hobby, but it is something i really enjoy, espessially when i'm not the one driving. I have a nine hour road trip coming up in two weeks to Oaklahoma with my boyfriend, and I think i'm more exited for the ride than the trip itself. What I love about long road trips especially is the different sites, because as you move along cities and states, the scenery changes so much and it's so comforting.
<h3>Thrifting</h3>

<p>The reason I love thrifting so much is because along with the cheap prices, you never know what your going to find. A lot of people aren't thrifting as much anymore because for some reason these buisnesses charge an arm and a leg for clothes they had donated to them, but thats why I only go to stores that have good sales. I love going with friends, but it's not as fun when your not finding anything good and they are. My favorite place to thrift is definitley the goodwill closest to my house in huntley, because they do half off tag days. I refuse to go to any goodwills that dont do half off days.</p>
